# Biography

I am a NOAA EPP Earth System Sciences and Remote Sensing Scholar at the University of Puerto Rico pursuing a doctoral's degree in Biological Oceanography. My research focuses on monitoring massive, seasonal *Sargassum* accumulation on the fringing mangroves ecosystem in southwestern Puerto Rico using in-situ and satellite observations. The arrival of drifting pelagic *Sargassum* is important to assess and quantify due to its many impacts on coastal ecosystems and water quality. This research mission is to communicate risk due to climate change and from *Sargassum* accumulation and decomposition on tropical shorelines and shallow waters. My post-graduation plan is to pursue a job where all my skills can be utilezed.
